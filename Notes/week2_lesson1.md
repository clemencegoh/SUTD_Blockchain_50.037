# The internet

Behaviours:
- Timing: Asynchronous
- Faults: Byzatine (arbitary (eg. adversarial) behaving)

---
System Types:
- Computing, trust, network, decision making, ...
- Centralized/Monarchy/Monopoly
    - One trusted node decides
- Decentralised/Oligarchy/Oligopoly
    - Multiple trusted nodes can decide, each individually
- Distributed/Open
    - Nodes collectively decide (no node individually trusted)

Properties of a **public ledger**:
- Immutability, Transparency, Availability, Censorhip-resistance, ...
- Potential:
    - General-purpose global database
    - All kinds of transactions, notaries, time stamping, state encoding, ...

- Eventually Nodes have to be trusted in some regard, eg. availability.
- Challenge comes when you want to:
    - Let everyone write
    - Large-scale consensus mechanism is inevitable
    - Who and why would run such an open infrastructure?

---
**Consensus**

- Different types of consensus
- Blockchain works on Proof of Work (PoW), the Nakamoto Consensus
    - When there are forks, the longest chain wins (Most PoW)


**CENTRALISED - DECENTRALISED - DISTRIBUTED**
Refer to image within Notes for difference.
Decentralised is better known as multi-centralised.
