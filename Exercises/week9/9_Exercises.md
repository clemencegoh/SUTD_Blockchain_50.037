## Week 9: Working with Ethereum Testnet

To approach this exercise session, we are going to use the following software:
* Mist/Metamask - Wallet for Ethereum
* Remix - Online IDE for Solidity
* Firefox with Metamask plugin - Browser with Ethereum and Bitcoin accounts
manager

**Note:** Learn about Geth (Ethereum console client) for the next week.

### Question 1

Using Mist/Metamask, create an Ethereum account, then get and spend some coins.

**Note:** Make sure you are using a Testnet network (use Ropsten by default).

### Question 2

Using an Ethereum testnet blockchain explorer, find information about the
account with ID: **0xDE314df1A5241D38E9603d784b8A186E0543521E**

* What is account's balance?
* When was last transaction performed?
* Does it have any smart contract created? If so, can you make reverse
engineering to understand what it does?

### Question 3

In Bitcoin, we have an option of creating multisig transactions. How it can be
realized in Ethereum?

### Question 4

Using Metamask and Remix, develop a simple decentralized lottery based on smart
contracts.

TODO:
* Define basic rules, such as minimum amount to bet
* How you can implement this lottery fair?
* Compare gas consumption of your implementation with your classmates

**Note:** Make sure you are using a recent version of Solidity.
