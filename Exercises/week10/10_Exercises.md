## Week 10: Ethereum private network and Solidity features

### Question 1

Using Geth, deploy a private Ethereum network. It should contains at least:
* a boot node
* two miners nodes
* two wallets (clients) with coins

Test your lottery's smart contract, developed last week, with this private network.

### Question 2

Solidity is a Turing-complete programming language, let's explorer more of its
capabilities modifying and extending the decentralized lottery developed last
week or doing testing code.

* Explore different data types
* Make use of struct types and mappings
* Create payable functions
* Define modifiers
* Implement inheritance from an existing deployed smart contract
* Play with functions visibility and understand their differences
* How is it possible to integrate a log?
* Is it possible to create an infinite loop?
* Calls between smart contracts
* Create a fallback function, how it works?
