Question 1
---
- Seed is needed since it is required to generate a random address
- Seed looks like this:
    - laptop charge clap hawk toy pond pony episode ethics original habit anchor
- "Confirmations" counts the number of blocks which have been mined after 
the block containing the transaction has been mined in.
- Transactions look like this:
    - ![example tx](./example_tx.JPG)
- Input:
    - Senders and how much they are sending
- Output:
    - Receivers and how much they are receiving
- No. All the balance from the sender will be sent in a transaction.
However, since the receiver only receives a part of it, the other 
"receiver" of the balance would be the sender.
